# Meine Blog

**The title basically mean my blog in german I tried to be creative**

The website is a blog I have created to gather some notes that I have learned throught out my journey in learning web development

## So lets go over some features in the blog :

- The posts database is hygraph its the place where all data are saved
- The API calls are done with GraphQl
- There is the ability to signUp to make a new account and sign in

  - Username,Email,Password validation are implemented to validate that inputs are valid
  - any Outside the requirements will result in error and email wouldnt be created

- Email vertification is required and is being done with firebase
  - If email isnt verified the user cant sign in
- You can add some posts to favourites list and see it when you come back

## Currently Working on :

    1. (âœ“)Shifting context API to use Redux as the project gets more complex (Compeleted)
    2. Adding the feature to add post directly from the website without the need to add it from the database (In progress)
